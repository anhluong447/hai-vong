# Hoi Am workspace state

Updated: 2026-10-22 (Asia/Bangkok).

## Latest user requirement: project containment

The entire project, plans, skills, dependencies, worktrees, portable toolchains,
caches, logs, temporary files and test browser profiles must stay inside the
project folder. No project installation into Windows/AppData/user/global folders;
no PATH/registry/service changes. Python packages use a private `.venv` with
system site packages disabled. Root AGENTS.md, coding rules, local skill and plan
now carry this requirement. Read the repository skill directly; do not install
or synchronize it externally.

## Active implementation location and progress

Original project: `C:/Users/anhlh52/AndroidStudioProjects/Ask`.
Implementation: `.worktrees/phase-0`, branch `feat/phase-0-skeleton-tools`.
Plan commit: `e9a4d83`; latest prior implementation commit: `6c09905`.
T01 through T05 are implemented and committed: contracts/checks, content/flags,
story session/checkpoints, JSON authoring workspace and resource pipeline/recovery.
T06 has only the native keyboard test driver. No playable 2D world exists yet.
T06 world/adapters and T07 through T14 remain; no 12-week production expansion.
The user authorized Phase 0 execution; the current priority was applying the new
containment requirement before continuing T06. No push, publication or merge.

## Containment implementation and recovery

- Bootstrap from the implementation checkout with `python -B tools/setup.py`.
  Then use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -B` (Windows) or `.venv/bin/python -B`.
  Pillow 12.3.0 and imageio-ffmpeg 0.6.0 are now installed only in this private venv.
  Existing system Python/browser executables are invoked without modification;
  the project no longer imports globally installed Pillow or `.cache/python`.
- Project commands reject non-venv execution. Shared environment setup redirects
  temp, pip/imageio/XDG caches and subprocess temp paths into `.cache/`. Pip user
  configuration and inherited destination settings are disabled during setup.
  Browser tests use disposable `.cache/tmp` profiles, not the normal user profile.
- Source-writer roots, bundle destinations and asset writes reject resolved paths
  outside the checkout. Source/restore/build files remain separate from caches.
- The old external project skill (4 files) and one empty leftover test profile were
  moved into the original project `.cache/recovered-external-artifacts/`.
  All 4 original skill SHA-256 hashes matched before/after; both external paths
  were verified absent. Recovery evidence is in that directory's verification.json.
  Historical archive skill-verification records describe the earlier installation;
  they are not instructions to reinstall it. Other existing software was untouched.
- The obsolete `.cache/python` dependency directory is inactive; no import path
  points to it. Only the venv supplies Python project dependencies going forward.

## Actual verification for containment

- RED: inherited external temp/cache defaults and missing venv guard reproduced;
  bundle/source writer tests also exposed missing external-root rejection without
  allowing the regression test to write outside the project.
- GREEN: 27 Python tests and 40 browser unit tests; 8 authoring browser tests;
  1 real-pack content test; architecture and asset audit pass. A real browser
  regression checks its profile/temp locations and profile cleanup on exit.
- Asset build through the new venv succeeds with zero changed renditions.
  The FFmpeg executable still matches its pinned SHA-256; audio conversion is
  exercised by the Python suite. Reports stay under implementation `.cache/test/`.
- Browser/Python tests require sandbox escalation on this machine due temporary
  directory ACLs. Escalation does not authorize an external installation and does
  not change Chrome's own sandbox. All project-managed output paths stay local.
- No running dev server is assumed. Production art/UI design and the remaining
  gameplay/editor/hot-reload/release work have not been completed by this change.

## Protected sources and historical evidence

Protected Bible/GDD files under `docs/design/narrative/` and `docs/design/gameplay/`
are unchanged. The ignored archive remains at `archive/legacy-2026-10-22/payload/`
in the original project: 35,171 files, 5,105,177,266 bytes, prior verification passed.
Its inventory SHA-256 is
`3962b62c8ff13fc30617322fde4b2ea83be9cc9e38c78a161f8c3490d53b8f3b`.
No full archive rehash was performed for this environment change.

Mandatory recovery: root AGENTS.md, this checkpoint, CODING-RULES.md, repository
SKILL.md, then the active implementation checkpoint/plan and relevant design sources.
A context summary does not replace reopening these files.

Active plan: [Phase 0](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-phase-0-skeleton-tools.md). Execution ledger: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-22-phase-0-skeleton-tools/`.
